# Crunchyroll Login Page Clone

This is a project involving cloning the sign up and log in page for the infamous Crunchyroll website. Crunchyroll is an anime streaming service, connecting anime and manga fans from around the world.

For this project, I decided to clone the sign up and log in page in a static format using the same features as if one was interacting with the site itself.
